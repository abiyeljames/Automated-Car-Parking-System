# Automated-Car-Parking-System

Car parking is a major issue in the modern congested cities of today. There simply are too many vehicles on the road and not enough parking spaces. 
In our days, finding an available parking space can be considered as time and fuel consuming. 
Therefore, it may cause drivers to be frustrated; which will lead to an inappropriate parking. 
This will lead to bad traffic around the parking space and sometimes leads to accidents also
Conventionally, car parking systems does not have any intelligent monitoring system. 
Parking slots are monitored by human beings. All vehicles that are entering into the parking space waste alot of time for searching a parking slot. 
Sometimes it creates blockage. 
Use of automated system for car parking monitoring will reduce the human efforts. So an efficient parking management system is needed. 
That is why this project proposes an Intelligent parking system that uses various sensors which will be based on Arduino and its application as interface to view available spaces. 
Thus in this project we demonstrated the use of IoT based parking management system that allows for efficient parking space utilization using IoT technology.
